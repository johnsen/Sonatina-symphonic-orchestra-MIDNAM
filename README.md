MIDNAM files for the Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra
http://sso.mattiaswestlund.net/

Made for a project with Ardour 3 and LinuxSampler on GNU/Linux, using these scripts to generate the MIDNAM files
https://github.com/johnsen/lscp2midnam


* You need the Sonatina SFZ library
http://sourceforge.net/projects/openoctave/files/libraries/

* Place the *.midnam files from the MIDNAM_MAPS folder in ~/.config/ardour3/patchfiles

* You should adjust the PATH in the Sonatina_0.1D.lscp file, otherwise LinuxSampler can't find your samples

* Start linuxsampler

* Load the complete lscp file: 
cat Sonatina_0.1D.lscp | nc localhost 8888 &
